- Ask follow-ups: "What about in Los Angeles?" after a Miami search

**Example Conversation:**

```
You: "Find me basketball players"
AI: "I found 25 basketball players. Would you like to filter by location?"
You: "Yes, Miami"
AI: "I found 5 basketball players in Miami. Here are the results..."
You: "Show me the point guards"
AI: "I found 2 point guards in Miami from the previous results..."
```
